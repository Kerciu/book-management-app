# Goodreads App Features Overview

This document outlines the core features of our book management application, inspired by Goodreads. While we draw from Goodreads’ successful functionalities, our app offers a modern, streamlined experience tailored to readers who want to track, discover, and share their reading journey.

## Books

Each book entry in the app provides rich information and user interaction options. The system is designed to help users manage their reading journey with clarity and ease.

### Book Details

Every book includes the following attributes:

- **Cover Image** - displays the book’s cover. If unavailable, a default placeholder with the app logo is used.
- **Title** - the full title of the book.
- **Author(s)** - one or more authors associated with the book.
- **Number of Pages** - essential for tracking reading progress.
- **ISBN** - unique identifier for cataloging.
- **Publication Date** - the original date of publication.

### Book Statistics

Each book displays basic community engagement stats:

- **Average User Rating** - calculated from all user-submitted ratings (e.g., 4.2/5).
- **Total Number of Ratings** - indicates how many users rated the book.
- **Readers Count** - shows how many users have added the book to any shelf.

### User Interactions

Users can perform the following actions on any book:

- **Add to Shelf Quickly** - one-click option to add a book to the “Want to Read” shelf.
- **Shelf Selector Dropdown** - tap to open a dropdown and select another shelf, such as:
    - *Currently Reading*
    - *Read*
    - *Custom Shelves* (e.g., "Favorites", "Abandoned", "Reread List")

- **Move or Remove from Shelves** - users can easily reassign a book to a different shelf or remove it altogether.
