# Goodreads App Features Overview

This document outlines the core features of our book management application, inspired by Goodreads. While we draw from Goodreads’ successful functionalities, our app offers a modern, streamlined experience tailored to readers who want to track, discover, and share their reading journey.

## Books

Each book entry in the app provides rich information and interactive features. The system is designed to help users manage their reading journey with clarity and ease.

### Book Details

Every book includes the following attributes:

* **Cover Image** – Displays the book’s cover. If unavailable, a default placeholder with the app logo is used.
* **Title** – The full title of the book.
* **Author(s)** – One or more authors associated with the book.
* **Number of Pages** – Essential for tracking reading progress.
* **ISBN** – A unique identifier for cataloging.
* **Publication Date** – The original date of publication.

### Book Statistics

Each book displays key community engagement metrics:

* **Average User Rating** – Calculated from all user-submitted ratings (e.g., 4.2/5).
* **Total Number of Ratings** – Indicates how many users have rated the book.
* **Readers Count** – Shows how many users have added the book to any shelf (e.g., “Read,” “Currently Reading”).

### User Interactions

Users can perform the following actions with any book:

* **Quick Add to Shelf** – One-click option to add a book to the “Want to Read” shelf.
* **Shelf Selector Dropdown** – Expandable menu to choose another shelf, such as:

  * *Currently Reading*
  * *Read*
  * *Custom Shelves* (e.g., "Favorites", "Abandoned", "To Reread")
* **Move or Remove from Shelves** – Easily reassign a book to a different shelf or remove it altogether.
* **Rate and Review** – Users can rate and review books once they’ve marked them as “Read.”
* **Add or Edit Reading Dates** – Users can specify or modify the start and end dates of their reading period.
* **Track Progress** – For books marked as “Currently Reading,” users can update their progress by entering how many pages they’ve read.

## Shelves

Shelves allow users to organize their books according to reading status or personalized categories. This system offers both flexibility and clarity in managing one’s reading journey.

### Default Shelves

Every user begins with three built-in shelves:

* **Want to Read** – For books the user intends to read.
* **Currently Reading** – For books the user is actively reading. Enables progress tracking.
* **Read** – For books the user has completed. Enables features like rating, reviewing, and tracking reading dates.

These shelves are system-defined and cannot be renamed or deleted to maintain consistency across the platform. Each book can be placed on only one default shelf at a time.

### Custom Shelves

Users can create additional shelves to suit their preferences, reading goals, or organization style. Examples include:

* *Favorites*
* *To Reread*
* *Abandoned*
* *2025 TBR*

Books can be added to multiple custom shelves simultaneously, allowing for more nuanced organization beyond default status-based shelving.

### Shelf Management

The app supports comprehensive shelf control:

* **Create and Name Custom Shelves** – Users can freely create shelves with meaningful or thematic labels.
* **Edit or Delete Custom Shelves** – Custom shelves can be renamed or removed at any time.
* **Assign Books to Shelves** – Users can move books between default shelves and tag them with multiple custom shelves without losing progress or metadata.
* **Filter by Shelf** – Users can filter their collection to display books from a specific shelf.
* **Sort Books Within Shelves** – Books can be sorted by:

  * Date added
  * Title (A–Z or Z–A)
  * Author
  * Personal rating
  * Average community rating
  * Date started or finished (if applicable)
